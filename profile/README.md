Real-time Digital Twin Platform for District Heating 

Gradyent enables district heating companies to optimise, decarbonise, and grow their grids through our real-time Digital Twin Platform. We've helped companies across Europe, including E.ON, Helen, Uniper, and Wien Energie to optimise their grid and run simulations of future situations. They have improved their grid performance, reduced CO2 emissions and operating costs, and made smarter business decisions by using the Digital Twin. Saving up to 15% heat loss, 10% CO2, 20% CAPEX, and 5% fuel costs.
