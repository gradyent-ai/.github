## Real-time Digital Twin Platform for District Heating 

More than 25% of global energy consumption comes from heating and cooling buildings. District heating is the largest opportunity to decarbonize this, as it unlocks the potential of low-carbon heat sources such as geothermal and waste heat. As heating grids transform, they will become increasingly complex and require a new approach to control and design. We believe that digital and data play a key role in this transformation and that traditional district heating tooling has been insufficient.  

Gradyent has developed software based on the Digital Twin technology: a digital copy of the physical heating system is made, combining geographical, weather, and sensor data with physics-based models and AI. The Gradyent Digital Twin is an end-to-end live platform, developed for the scale and complexity of modern district heating systems. The Digital Twin makes it possible to optimize the heating grid in real-time and to run simulations of future situations, saving on average up to 15% heat loss, 10% CO2 emissions, 5% fuel costs, and 20% lower CAPEX, while increasing the security of end-user heat supply. 

We work for large heating companies in Europe such as E.ON, Eneco, Ennatuurlijk, Helen, Turku Energia, Uniper, and Wien Energie. Our team consists of 50+ energy specialists, engineers, data scientists, commercial people, and top-tier consulting alumni, and is backed by investors Capricorn Partners, Eneco, ENERGIIQ, and Helen Ventures.
